::debounce

small debounce library for golang.

the configured debounce timeout starts on the first call to `Trigger()`.
any subsequent calls re-start the timeout.

all calls to `Trigger()` return `<-chan error`.
this will contain the error from the execution of the debounced function.
it must be drained by the caller.

read the code for the public api.
